# Java_Shell_Menu
This is a shell for a menu in Java. The main menu uses GridBagLayout to display all the text and buttons. The program has five submenus with examples of various user input to grab.

Submenu 1 This submenu is a simple JOptionPane.showInputDialog. It prompts a user for text input and prints what was input into system.out. This can be manipulated to do other things by editing line 12 and by doing something else with teh variable "colorEnter".

Submenu 2 This submenu uses checkboxes and a button. As it stands now, it merely shows a JOptionPane.showMessageDialog of which of the checkboxes were checked. This can be manipulated to do other things by editing line 84.

Submenu 3 This submenu is just another shell menu item with two buttons paired with two descriptions next to them. It also uses a GridBagLayout. Actions can be manipulated by editing lines 104 and 109 in the action listeners.

Submenu 4 This submenu is a simple JFrame with an additional single button. This can be used to display simple information.

Submenu 5 This submenu uses radio buttons. Right now it merely displays which radio button was pushed after clicking the button. This can be manipulated by editing the if statements withint he action listener that starts on line 81.
